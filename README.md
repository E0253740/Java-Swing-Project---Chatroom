# Java Swing Project - Online Chatroom
This is project is a practice of Java Swing and Socket.<br/>
Two main Java files can be found here: 
1. **BeatBoxFinal** - for client side (客户端)
2. **MusicServer** - for server side (服务器)

## BeatBoxFinal
This java class includes the application of multiple **data structures** such as array, list (ArrayList & LinkedList) and HashMap. <br/>
Java Swing package is used for basic **GUI** (Graph User Interface). <br/>
Specially, we can see **inner class** here, which is quite special and the application here is a good demonstration of how we apply inner class concept.<br/>
The details is commented in the java file, while I'll show the visual of progress here.<br/>

**startUp** is the method that calls the other methods and create socket connection <br/>
**buildGUI** is where we use Java Swing to build the GUI (visualisation) <br/>
